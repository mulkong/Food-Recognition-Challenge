This is a novel dataset of food images collected through the MyFoodRepo app where numerous volunteer Swiss users provide images of their daily food intake in the context of a digital cohort called Food & You. This growing data set has been annotated - or automatic annotations have been verified - with respect to segmentation, classification (mapping the individual food items onto an ontology of Swiss Food items), and weight / volume estimation.


### About Dataset
- train data: 7,949 images, 61 classes
- validation data: 418 images, 61 classes

### The purpose of the challenge
Detect the food in the image using Mask RCNN


## Mask R-CNN

Mask RCNN is a deep neural network aimed to solve instance segmentation problem in machine learning or computer vision. In other words, it can separate different objects in a image or a video. You give it a image, it gives you the object bounding boxes, classes and masks.

### Pre-trained weights
To train Mask R-CNN, we used pre-trained weight of Matterport Mask R-CNN.
